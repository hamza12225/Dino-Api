# Dino-Api

Dino API is a simple Express.js application that serves a static list of dinosaur data. The application runs on the PORT environment variable or 8000 if the environment variable is not set. The dinosaur data is hardcoded in the form of an array of JSON objects, with each object representing a dinosaur and its properties such as name, type, diet, weight, length, and period.

This API can be used as a mock data source for various applications that require dinosaur data, such as educational websites, games, or scientific research. The API endpoints can be easily extended to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it a versatile tool for developers.
